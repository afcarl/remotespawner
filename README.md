# remotespawner
Remote Spawner class for JupyterHub to spawn IPython notebooks and a remote server and tunnel the port via SSH

Need to have passwordless SSH access to remote server, need to setup `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
c.RemoteSpawner.server_url = "docker3" # or IP
c.RemoteSpawner.server_user = "zonca"
```

And needs the 8081 port of the local machine that runs `jupyterhub` to be forwarded to 
the remote server.

Currently in development, it sort of works.

See the `qsub` branch for a proof-of-concept integration with Torque.
